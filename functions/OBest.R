#' Oaxaca-Blinder estimator for a whole sample
#' 
#' From a sample of treated and control units, computes the weights
#' for each counterfactual, the individual treatment effects and counterfactuals,
#' and the Average Treatment on the Treated (ATT). Based on Kline (2011).

#' @param d is a vector of dimension n (treatment indicator)
#' @param X is a n x p matrix
#' @param y is a vector of dimension n (outcome)
#' 
#' @return ATT is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated over the sample.
#' @return CATT is the individual treatment effect.
#' @return Wsol is the n1 x n0 matrix of weights to compute counterfactual.
#' @return y0_hat is the individual counterfactual for each treated unit.
#' 
#' @seealso \code{\link{matching}} for the computation of the matching weights.
